# Privacy Policy

Your data always belongs to you, and only you. WebArchive does not collect any
data.

## How your data is protected and used

- WebArchive sends data to the server address configured in the extension,
  typically a Cloudflare Page that you have deployed yourself.
- If you have configured AI-related APIs, data will also be sent to these APIs.
- Screenshots are only taken when you choose to save a page.
